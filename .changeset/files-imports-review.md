Files and imports: import uploads count toward your storage, unsubmitted imports are cleaned up after 30 days, and two commits of the same import can no longer both write. File processing is faster and more robust (first-page thumbnails only, scanned pages read in parallel and one bad page no longer fails the file, missing embeddings are retried). Search is quicker, long file lists scroll smoothly, and uploads show real progress. Syllabus imports wait for course files that are still processing, read GBK text and phone photos correctly, cancel classes on "no class" dates, and share category weights across their assessments.

文件与导入：导入的上传计入存储空间，30 天没提交的导入会被清理，同一次导入不会被提交两次。文件处理更快更稳（只生成首页缩略图，扫描页并行识别，单页出错不再让整个文件失败，缺失的向量会自动补齐）。检索更快，长文件列表滚动流畅，上传显示真实进度。课程大纲导入会等待仍在处理的课程文件，能正确读取 GBK 文本和手机照片，"停课"日期会取消对应的上课时间，分类权重会分摊到各项考核。
